This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
 
 # This was my very first React app from 2018, it interfaces with the blockchain and utilizes some crypto currency APIs to get some market data. It is meant to point to a host Augur-Node which is another project in my profile.
 
 ## This was just an app I put together when I was bored and was curious about blockchain and wanted to try out some React. It has been almost 2 years since I have looked at this code, and I have only been developing for roughly two years. Just for a reference.
